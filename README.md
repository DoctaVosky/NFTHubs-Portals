## What is NFTHubs?

<p>Welcome to NFTHubs, this is our beta website as we are a brand new company delving into the Crypto and NFT world. Here we share some information on us as a company, how we work and some info on this new wave called Smart contract NFTs’. Our goal is to help content creators securely and for a lower cost create NFTs across multiple block-chains while helping grow the community.</p>


## What are NFTs’

<p>A NFT is a non-fungible token similar to a bitcoin token or an ethereum except it’s customizable and it’s worth is chosen by the seller or it’s price after a bid. They can be on any block chain that allows it and can be accessed and stored in any wallet that uses said block chain that the nft is on. There are forums if you want to learn about their code aswell.</p>
