# NFTHubs-Portals

## What is NFTHubs?

<p><strong>Welcome to NFTHubs</strong>, this is our beta website as we are a brand new company delving into the Crypto and NFT world. Here we share some information on us as a company. We will explain how we work and also delve into some of the basic info on this new wave called Smart contract NFTs’. Our goal is to help content creators securely create NFTs across multiple block-chains at a lower price while helping grow the community.</p>


## What are NFTs’

<p><strong>A NFT is a non-fungible token similar to a bitcoin token or an ethereum</strong> except it’s customizable and it’s worth is chosen by the seller or it’s price after a bid. They can be on any block chain that allows it and can be accessed and stored in any wallet that uses said block chain that the NFT is on. There are forums containing all of the informtion regarding NFTs and their creation if you want to learn about the code behind the NFT as well.</p>

## NFT Marketplaces We Are Available At

<p><strong>The marketplaces that we are currently using are Rariable, Opensea and NFT trade.</strong> Depending on which block chain network you choose to create your NFT on and the marketplace you want to sell or bid on, <strong>the creation cost and pay out will be subject to change based on these factors above.</strong></p>

<p>At this point in time we scrub all photos and videos of meta-data for your security then on the block chain and market place of your choosing we create, mint and sell on our verified accounts on the marketplace of your choosing. Allowing you to create content and watch your NFT be sold and the money will hit your account promptly. With time this will all be automated on our website but until then we will continue to do it hands on. We will also post and re-post all creations/sells and bids on our social media accounts to get as many eyes on your NFT as possible. This goes for all categories of content including our partners on Only Fans, Patreon and Twitch and any of those partners that we continually to do business with we will subscribe to said page/channel as we would like to set up as many collaborations as we possibly can have.</p>

# Buying and Selling NFTs

<p><strong>Whether you’re someone who is looking to sell content or someone looking to buy and obtain content semi or solely exclusive, NFT smart contracts are new option and a new area to do so; furthermore the community is everywhere;</strong> NFT’s are a growing sensation with etxtreme potential especially with the use of block chain networks. At the moment we create erc-721 tokens and Tezos TZIP-16 tokens which are 1/1’s. Which means there is only one in existence out of a collection of one. However soon we will be using erc-1155 which is a collection of x/x. Which means if we were looking to create a collection of 10 nfts there would be 10 copies of the same nft that multiple people could bid on individually or collectively and re -sell in the future just like a 1/1. However it’s rarity isn’t as high; as more than one person has a piece of a set.</p>

<p>Most marketplaces allow their users to create, mint and sell/bid nft’s straight from the website. Allowing users easy access to creating and selling however this limits the ability to customize the nft and includes convenience for using their services. There are also prerequisites to becoming a verified seller meaning your nft’s and profile page can be searched for and accessed without a direct link by potential buyers. This can include having a specific amount of a crypto coin such as Open seas 1 ethereum requirement, or Rariables’ 2 week long verification which includes multiple steps. <strong>With our business model at NFT-Hubs we lessen those fees to just the gas fees, initial mint fees without  convenience costs added and a x percentage on the overall sell.</strong> Which allows you the buyer to save more and to take more profit from beginning to the end of sell on each nft.</p>

# Here's How It Works
<p>You have the option between Tezos and ethereum block chains until further notice. Choice of Rariable and opensea or nft marketplace for sell/bidding platforms. Aswell as what content to add as meta data, name of your nft and the cover photo of your nft, with the choice of us selling/bidding the nft for you after initial creation and minting.</p>


# What Are Gas Fees?
<p>Gas fees are transaction fees set by the miners who authorize and process each transaction and movement across the block-chain. Depending on how many processes are being inquired across the network these fees can vary and change in price. Also how much data being processed has an effect on the gas fee so we take this into consideration and choose to create and mint it within a x hour window to ensure the lowest price available.</p>

## Different examples of nft’s created and sold by others across different marketplaces types of content:

<p>is a great example of a content creator with a fan base who was able to sell an erc-1155 token smart contract in a bid for a high sum of money, with her meta data containing 10 images. Kara Del Toro is known to be the first model to collaborate and get a nft created, minted and sold in a bid on Open sea, one of the largest nft marketplaces out right now.</p>
